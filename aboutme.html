<p style ="font-family: verdana; text-align:center;">Hi! My name is Tara and I am an incoming senior 

at Washington High School in Fremont, CA. I consider myself an extroverted introvert. 

I love listening to music and discovering new TV shows. My favorite food is Thai food 

and my least favorite foods are lentils and eggplant. A fun fact about myself is that

I was allergic to chocolate for five years. </p>
