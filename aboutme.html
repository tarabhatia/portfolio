<p style ="font-family: verdana; text-align:center;">Hi! My name is Tara and I am an incoming senior 

at Washington High School in Fremont, CA. I consider myself an extroverted introvert. 

I love listening to music and discovering new TV shows. My favorite food is Thai food 

and my least favorite foods are lentils and eggplant. A fun fact about myself is that

I was allergic to chocolate for five years. </p>

<h1 style="font-family: verdana; text-align:center;">Scratch Game</h1>



<p style ="font-family: verdana; text-align:center;">In this Scratch side-scroller game,

the main objective is to get the knight to save the princess while overcoming obstacles 

along the way. To play, you must use the up arrow key to jump and the left and right arrow

to move the knight across the grass</p>

<h1 style="font-family: verdana; text-align:center;">Scratch vs. Python</h1>



<p style ="font-family: verdana; text-align:center;">It was fun learning about the similarities between Scratch and Python. 
Scratch used a more visual way to display the code, while python seems more mature and used in the real world. Both use things
like variables and help a program run. Python can vary stylistically in the way it is written, while Scratch does not.</p>
